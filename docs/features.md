## 🤖 Advanced AI Features

### 5. 💬 Emotion + Intent Classifier (Custom ML/NLP)
- Built-from-scratch ML model predicts:
  - Primary emotion(s) from journal
  - Intent (e.g., reflection, ranting, motivation)
- Learns from user feedback (semi-supervised fine-tuning)

### 6. 🧠 Digital Twin Memory Engine
- Stores user entries, moods, and goals as vector embeddings
- Uses **FAISS** or **Pinecone** to retrieve past data contextually
- GPT uses memory to respond like “you know me”

### 7. 🔄 Conversational Agent (GenAI Life Coach)
- Chat interface with GPT-4
- Context-aware, goal-aware — like talking to a personal mentor
- Adapts tone/motivation style based on mood history

### 8. 🕒 Time-Aware GPT Insights
- GPT uses timestamps to give smart advice:
  - “You’re always low energy on Mondays. Let’s fix that.”
  - “Last week your mood improved with 8+ hour sleep. Continue?”

### 9. 📚 Topic Modeling (Optional NLP Model)
- Extracts dominant themes from journals (e.g., "work stress", "relationships")
- Clusters journal entries into categories
- Gives feedback on what you write most about
